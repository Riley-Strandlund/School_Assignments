            <h2 class="section-header">Favorite Movie</h2>
                <p>My favorite movie is <i><span id="favorite-movie-title">Dracula Untold</span></i>. The movie is about a king that was forced to give the children of his kingdom to the Ottomon Empire or fight an impossible battle. 
                    Despite knowing they won't win the king decides to fight the army, and to do so he becomes a vampire granting him extraordinary abilities. At this point he can still return 
                    to being human until his wife is killed and his son is kidnapped. The king then with his wifes blessing drinks her blood and becomes a full vampire renaming himself to Dracula.
                    This is the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829150/">IMDB</a> for the movie.</p>
